# StockManagement
The `StoreManagement` system is located in the `StoreManagement` folder. This project is responsible for inventory management, including stock levels, supplier details, and item management. I handled this portion of the project for a team project in my CSC340 Ethics and Software Engineering class. 

**Opening the Project:**
- Go to the `StoreManagement` folder.
- Open the `StoreManagement.sln` file using Visual Studio 2022 or newer.
